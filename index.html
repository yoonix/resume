          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I am seeking the opportunity to be the technical leader for a Cloud Operations 
            team. I hope to leverage the experiences I've gained managing internet-facing 
            production environments for nearly 30 years by mentoring other engineers on 
            Linux, Ansible, Kubernetes, and other modern cloud technologies.  I am motivated 
            to build stable, easy to manage environments and replace time-wasting technical 
            debt with long-term solutions utilizing DevOps best practices.
